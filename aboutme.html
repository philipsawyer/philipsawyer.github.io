				<h3>Hello</h3>
				<p>I have always had a fascination with technology, but it wasn't until Apple released the iOS SDK in 2008, that my interest really peaked. I spent the next few years reading books and working through online tutorials in my spare time to learn how to code and develop an iOS app.
In early 2013, I launched my first iPhone app called 'Attendance!' It provides a simple way for teachers to take attendance in their classrooms. Later that year, I launched 'Fusion.' It combines all of the major social networks so they can be viewed simultaneously.
Fast forward to today, I am a sophomore studying Software Engineering at Auburn University (War Eagle!). I now have experience in HTML, Java, PHP, and Swift programming. I have several apps I am currently working on which should be released in the near future.</p>
